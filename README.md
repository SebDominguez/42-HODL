7. Capsule cap
8. Capsule body
9. Mj√∂llnir

## Let's whack some washers!

First use the loop tape trick to secure the washer so it stands still while we punch him

![Tape the washer on the base](./img/2.png)

Place the base of the 3D printed jig on top of the washer

Place the top part of the jig in the first position so we can write down the number of the seed (01)

Now position the punch inside the punch hole after double checking that you have the correct orientation.

Now give it a gentle kiss with your thumb detector (no need to go full force strong guy, if you warp the washer it's  a sign that you are doing it wrong)

See how easy it is?

Let's continue

Nice! Now repeat this 23 times...

When you are donzo just bolt the washers together with the Allan key and the wrench
